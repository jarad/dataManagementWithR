# Data Pipeline

## Introduction

Researchers often consider their data static, but in reality their data are 
dynamic and undergo modification from data collection to data analysis to 
data publication. 
It is helpful to have an understanding of this process so that data can be 
managed as the dynamic object. 

### A water analogy

An analogy for data is water. 
Water initially falls from the sky as rain, snow, sleet, or hail. 
From this point water can be absorbed into the ground, it can re-evaporate,
and it can join together to create brooks. 
These brooks join together to form creeks then branches and then into a river. 
This can be thought of as the process of data collection.

As the water flows downstream it has many purposes. 
For example, humans pull water from the stream for personal uses such as 
drinking, showering, cleaning, etc.
We also pull water for industrial purposes. 
Animals will also drink from the water. 
This is analogous to the many different purposes that data have including
for journal articles, for posters or oral presentations at a conference,
for stakeholder summaries, etc. 

The process described here is a natural process and natural systems go awry. 
A stream might flood or become dry. 
Water might get absorbed into the ground rather than flowing downstream for its
intended purpose. 
The water itself gets mixed all together so that it is unclear where it came
from. 
In dealing with our data, we do not want to allow these natural "disasters" to 
occur, but instead we want to exhibit more control over our data. 

### Data Pipeline

Rather than letting our data flow natural, we want to exhibit more control by
constructing a data pipeline. 
We want to be intentional about how we are dealing with the data.
We want to back the data up so that we have multiple identical rivers so that
a dried up riverbed does not end out scientific career. 

This data pipeline is constructed of a collection of individual steps that 
should be enumerated and described. 
These steps may include, but are not limited to, the following possible 
individual steps that we will describe in the remainder of this chapter:

- Data Collection
- Data Digitization
- Data Validation
- Data Transformation
- Data Backup
- Data Archiving
- Data Analysis
- Data Sharing
- Data Publication

These steps in a data pipeline are provided in a rough chronological order for
how they exist in the pipeline.
But it is important to note that some of these activities will occur 
simultaneously and therefore the pipeline must nimble enough to handle this 
simultaneous use. 


## Data Collection

The process of collecting data can be broadly categorized by how the data are 
obtained and what downstream processing will need to occur. 
These categories are 

- field data sheets
- electronic entry
- automatic recording

### Field data sheets

The least technologically-savvy approach is recording data on a field data sheet
or laboratory notebook. 
This means that someone is physically writing the data down onto a piece of 
loose-leaf or bound paper.
These data will need to be entered in the Data Digitization step in order for 
useful analyses to be performed. 

### Electronic entry

More and more field and laboratory data are entered directly into an electronic 
form by a researcher bypassing the physical piece of paper. 
This step bypasses the need for a Data Digitization step, but care is required
in developing the electronic entry system to ensure data quality because there
is no alternative record as a backup. 


### Automatic recording

With all automation, field and laboratory research is becoming automated via 
the use of electronic systems that automatically record data. 
These systems require calibration to ensure data quality and must be checked
frequently to ensure the systems are operating properly. 


## Data Digitization

When data are recorded in a field data sheet or a laboratory notebook, 
they will then need to be digitized, i.e. entered into an electronic form.
