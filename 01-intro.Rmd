# Introduction {#intro}

Data management comprises the following steps

1. data collection,
1. data cleaning,
1. data validation,
1. data visualization, and
1. data analysis

Thus, in this text, we will discuss each of these steps in turn and
I will provide my opinion on how to perform these steps.
Generally, the advice is agnostic about the software being used, 
but in places the advice will be specific to the 
[R software environment](http://r-project.org/).

The most important part of data management is 

    Have a plan and stick to it!
    
If you have a plan and stick to it, 
then it will be relatively easy to make a change to the plan.
In constrast, 
if you don't have a plan, then all bets are off.

So don't try to perfect your data management at first. 
Instead, 

1. set a plan, 
1. periodically review the plan, and 
1. revise the plan as needed.

## Purpose

Data management is one piece of the pipeline in scientific discovery and 
development. 
The purpose of data management is to make data analysis and 
therefore science itself accurate, easy, and reproducible.

I have some principles that aim to help the design of a data management plan

- Be consistent
- Store each piece of data only once
- Touch the
