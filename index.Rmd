# Preface

Data management is an integral part of reproducible scientific inquiry, 
but it seems to not get much attention relative to the attention given to data
analysis. 
Thus this book presents my approach to data management using the open-source
software R. 
Due to the capability to use R, 
I will generally be considering small to moderate sized data sets of the type
typically found in research endeavours in academia. 
My approach to data management is intended to be prescriptive in that it 
provides instructions that the user can follow. 
A user can decide to deviate from these instructions,
but I hope this book gives some rationale for why I do what I do.
