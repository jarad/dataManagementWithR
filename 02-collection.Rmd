# Collection {#collect}

Data collection is the process of collecting data. 
Before construction of a data collection protocol, 
the reader should be familiar with future aspects of the data management 
pipeline and thus I suggest reading (or at least skimming) through the remainder
of the book in order to fully understand the suggests given here. 


There are three main ways data are collected

  1. Lab notebook or field sheets
  1. Direct digital entry
  1. Automated digital file
  
In lab notebooks or field sheets the data are written down on paper and 
will need to be entered into a computer and saved as a digital file later. 
In direct digital entry, a data recorded inputs the data directly into a 
computer and saves the results as a digital file, 
but does not have an original paper copy.
Finally, an automated digital file is created by a machine connected to 
a computer and the machine automatically creates a digital file.
